# Car Brand Analyzer

This Python application is designed to analyze a list of cars from a user-specified file. It prompts the user to input the file to be analyzed and the file to which the summary will be written. The program then calculates the frequency of each car brand in the list, displaying the results in alphabetical order along with their respective occurrence counts.

The implementation comprises the main program along with three additional subprograms for file handling, analysis, and summary writing. In case the specified file is empty, the program outputs a message stating, "The file was empty, no car brand was recognized."
